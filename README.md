#japeto-convo-classifier

Machine learning project for Japeto Chat to categorise AI-generated chatbot responses.
Trained on 1,500+ tagged conversations, the model classifies responses into predefined categories to improve analytics accuracy and insights for chatbot owners in healthcare, government, and education.

#Project Overview

Japeto Chat enables organisations to build and manage AI-driven chatbots.
While scripted responses are pre-tagged, AI-generated responses lack category labels, limiting analytics.
This project develops a classifier to categorise AI-generated chatbot responses with an accuracy target of 85% or higher.

#Features

Classifies AI-generated responses into meaningful categories

Uses a dataset of 1,500+ tagged chatbot conversations

Supports real-time or batch classification

Enhances chatbot analytics dashboard visibility

Built with Python, Jupyter, scikit-learn, and transformers
